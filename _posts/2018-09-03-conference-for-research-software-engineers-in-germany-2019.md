Following the success of the [First and Second international Conference of Research Software Engineers in the UK](https://rse.ac.uk/events/past-conferences/), a national conference addressing research software and the people behind in the German research landscape will be held at the Albert Einstein Science Park in Potsdam on June 4-6 2019.

We are expecting a lively mix of 200 attendees from different research domains. The purpose of this national conference is to get together with people who develop software that is used in any field of research. We call these people Research Software Engineers (RSEs), but they exist under many job titles (from postdoctoral researcher to research associate, to faculty).

\#deRSE19 is not a standard academic conference. We welcome researchers, but we also want to hear from people who fund, develop, run or maintain research software and may not typically attend conferences. It's a community conference: get involved and help us build the RSE Community in Germany. So save the date and spread the word to your peers writing software for research.

Stay in touch with us and get the latest updates by registering at [konferenz-updates@de-rse.org](https://ml06.ispgateway.de/mailman/listinfo/konferenz-updates_de-rse.org). We will announce the opening of the calls for sessions soon, followed by the calls for talks, posters, workshops and tutorials by end of this year. Updates about the conference will be available also by [@RSE_de at twitter](https://twitter.com/rse_de). The hashtag for the event is #deRSE19.

If you have any questions about the conference, please contact the conference organisers at [konferenz@de-rse.org](mailto:konferenz@de-rse.org).

Kind regards,

The #deRSE19 Conference Committee
