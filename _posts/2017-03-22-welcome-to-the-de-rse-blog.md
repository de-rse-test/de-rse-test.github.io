This weblog will contain posts on subjects that are relevant to the Research Software Engineers community.

**You, too**, can contribute (in English or German). Simply clone [this website's GitHub repository](https://github.com/DE-RSE/www), check out the [README](https://github.com/DE-RSE/www/blob/master/README.md) (we use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and it's easy to create and publish drafts with `rake`), create a blog post, and submit it to us via a GitHub pull request against `gh-pages`!

Happy reading, happy contributing!
