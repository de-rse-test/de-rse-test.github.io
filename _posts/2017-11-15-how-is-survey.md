Did fill out the [survey](/blog/2017/10/19/survey-about-research-software-in-germany-2017.html)? Yes, great! 

So let's check quickly how many people filled it out as well.

![survey responses]({{ "/assets/img/blog/2017/dersesurvey2017responsecount.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: width="800px"}

Not bad, there are almost 300 answers! But on the other hand I only see 3 persons per university creating research software in average, which seems a bit odd.
 
Let's see how many more people can answer the survey till end of the year.
